# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
`Static Assets` - unchanging files delivered to the client exactly as they are stored on a server. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, videos, fonts, and documents. For React projects, we need to "build" our project to generate static assets (convert .jsx files to .js files).
