# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
`Middleware` is a function in express that intercepts and processes incoming HTTP requests. It can perform server-side actions such as parsing the request, modifying the response, or executing additional logic before passing control to the next middleware in the chain."

A `controller` is a callback function that parses a request and sends a response. It will be invoked by the Express app when the associated endpoint is sent a request.
The controller receives a req object from the Express app which holds data about the request, including query parameters.
It also receives a res object which has methods to send a response.

The purpose of middleware acats as a bridge between the request and response cycle.
